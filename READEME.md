# Data Scientist Nanodegree - Capstone Project

## Project motivation

This is the Capstone Project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I analyzed
the Sparkify dataset - a ficticious music streaming service - and developed a machine learning model that predicts churn.

## Installation 

This project was implemented in Python 3.6 and made use of the following python libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
- [Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [DTW](https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/python/)

## Files

- sparkify.ipynb: jupyter notebook on which the project was developed.  
  

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Project1/` and run the following command:  
```jupyter notebook Sparkify.ipynb```


### Acknowledgements

The Sparkify dataset was provided by Udacity.
